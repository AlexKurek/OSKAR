This folder contains the source code for the library module: oskar_ms
The library provides a high level interface for writing measurement sets.

    cfitsio
    wcs

Building casacore.
===============================================================================
A single libcasacore.so can be built using the current source release using the
command:
    make libcasacore
(note this is not using scons but makefile that can be found in the top level
source directory)

Simply using
    make
will build a single set of the shared module libraries.

otherwise see: http://code.google.com/p/casacore/wiki/BuildInstructions
for build instructions using scons.
