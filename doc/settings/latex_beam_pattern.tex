&
station\_id
&
The station ID number (zero based) to select from the telescope model when generating the beam pattern.
&
Unsigned int
&
0
\\
\hline

174
&
beam\_image/size
&
Image dimensions. If a single value is specified, the image is assumed to have the same number of pixels along each dimension.<br /> Example: <ul> <li>A value of `256' results in a square image of size 256 by 256 pixels.</li> <li>A value of `256,128' results in an image of 256 by 128 pixels, with 256 pixels along the Right Ascension direction.</li> </ul>
&
Allowed values
&
256
\\
\hline

175
&
beam\_image/fov\_deg
&
Field-of-view (FOV) in degrees (max 180.0). If a single value is specified, the image is assumed to have the same FOV along each dimension. <br /> Example: <ul> <li>A value of `2.0' results in an image with a FOV of 2.0 degrees in each dimension.</li> <li>A value of `2.0,1.0' results in an image with a FOV of 2.0 degrees in Right Ascension, and 1.0 degrees in Declination.</li> </ul>
&
Allowed values
&
2.0
\\
\hline

176
&
root\_path
&
Root path name of the generated data file. Appropriate suffixes and extensions will be added to this, based on the settings below.
&
Path name
&
None
\\
\hline

177
&
oskar\_image\_file/save\_voltage
&
If true, save the voltage amplitude pattern in an OSKAR image file. (This is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary values.)
&
Bool
&
false
\\
\hline

178
&
oskar\_image\_file/save\_phase
&
If true, save the phase pattern in an OSKAR image file.
&
Bool
&
false
\\
\hline

179
&
oskar\_image\_file/save\_complex
&
If true, save the complex (real and imaginary) pattern in an OSKAR image file.
&
Bool
&
false
\\
\hline

180
&
oskar\_image\_file/save\_total\_intensity
&
If true, save the total intensity beam. This is evaluated as the Stokes I response of the beam pattern auto-correlation.
&
Bool
&
false
\\
\hline

181
&
fits\_file/save\_voltage
&
If true, save the voltage amplitude pattern in a FITS image file. (This is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary values.)
&
Bool
&
false
\\
\hline

182
&
fits\_file/save\_phase
&
If true, save the phase pattern in a FITS image file.
&
Bool
&
false
\\
\hline

183
&
fits\_file/save\_total\_intensity
&
If true, save the total intensity beam. This is evaluated as the Stokes-I response of the beam pattern auto-correlation.
&
Bool
&
false
\\
