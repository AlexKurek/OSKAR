station\_id
&
{The station ID number (zero based) to select from the telescope model when generating the beam pattern.}

Unsigned integer

&
beam\_image/size
&
{Image dimensions. If a single value is specified, the image is assumed to have the same number of pixels along each dimension. Example: {\begin{itemize}
 \item {A value of `256' results in a square image of size 256 by 256 pixels.}
 \item {A value of `256,128' results in an image of 256 by 128 pixels, with 256 pixels along the Right Ascension direction.}
 \end{itemize}}

185
&
beam\_image/fov\_deg
&
{Field-of-view (FOV) in degrees (max 180.0). If a single value is specified, the image is assumed to have the same FOV along each dimension.  Example: {\begin{itemize}
 \item {A value of `2.0' results in an image with a FOV of 2.0 degrees in each dimension.}
 \item {A value of `2.0,1.0' results in an image with a FOV of 2.0 degrees in Right Ascension, and 1.0 degrees in Declination.}
 \end{itemize}}

Double, or CSV list of doubles.
