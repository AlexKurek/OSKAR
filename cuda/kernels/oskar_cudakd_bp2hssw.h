/**
 * @brief
 * CUDA kernel to compute a beam pattern using the given weights vector.
 *
 * @details
 * This CUDA kernel evaluates the beam pattern for the given antenna
 * positions and weights vector, using the supplied positions of the test
 * source. The response from each antenna is modelled as a sine-squared
 * function that is azimuthally symmetric around the zenith.
 *
 * Each thread evaluates a single pixel of the beam pattern, looping over
 * all the antennas while performing a complex multiply-accumulate with the
 * required beamforming weights.
 *
 * The computed beam pattern is returned in the \p image array, which
 * must be pre-sized to length 2*ns. The values in the \p image array
 * are alternate (real, imag) pairs for each test source position.
 *
 * The number of floating-point operations performed by this kernel is:
 * \li Sines and cosines: ns * (2 * na + 3).
 * \li Multiplies: 8 * ns * na.
 * \li Additions / subtractions: 5 * ns * na.
 *
 * @param[in] na Number of antennas.
 * @param[in] ax Array of antenna x positions in metres.
 * @param[in] ay Array of antenna y positions in metres.
 * @param[in] weights Array of complex antenna weights (length na).
 * @param[in] ns The number of test source positions.
 * @param[in] saz The azimuth coordinates of the test source in radians.
 * @param[in] sel The elevation coordinates of the test source in radians.
 * @param[in] k The wavenumber (rad / m).
 * @param[out] image The computed beam pattern (see note, above).
