/**
 * @brief
 * Inserts (copies) a block of memory into another block of memory.
 *
 * @details
 * This function copies data held in one structure to another structure at a
 * specified element offset.
 *
 * Both data structures must be of the same data type, and there must be enough
 * memory in the destination structure to hold the result: otherwise, an error
 * is returned.
 *
 * @param[out] dst    Pointer to destination data structure to copy into.
 * @param[in]  src    Pointer to source data structure to copy from.
 * @param[in]  offset Offset into destination memory block.
 *
 * @return
 * This function returns a code to indicate if there were errors in execution:
 * - A return code of 0 indicates no error.
 * - A positive return code indicates a CUDA error.
 * - A negative return code indicates an OSKAR error.
