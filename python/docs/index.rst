oskarpy documentation
=====================

This is the documentation for the Python bindings to OSKAR.
The main motivations for providing Python bindings are:

1. to make it easier to run OSKAR from a scripting environment, and;

2. to allow access to data products and functions directly without having to
   resort to writing parameter files, or saving and loading data to and from
   disk where this is unnecessary.

See the :ref:`quickstart` guide for installation instructions.
