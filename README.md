# OSKAR: A GPU accelerated simulator for the Square Kilometre Array

OSKAR has been designed to produce simulated visibility data from radio
telescopes containing aperture arrays, such as those envisaged for the
Square Kilometre Array.

In order to run OSKAR, you will need a CUDA-capable NVIDIA graphics
processing unit (GPU). Please see INSTALL.md for a quick installation guide.

Full documentation and software can be found at http://oskar.oerc.ox.ac.uk

Please do not expect code in any development branch (including master)
to work as expected.
Only use the tagged versions at https://github.com/OxfordSKA/OSKAR/releases/

Please email oskar@oerc.ox.ac.uk if you encounter problems using OSKAR.
