2012-mm-dd  (Next release)

    * Embedded simulation log in output files.

    * Added run progress dialog to show log in GUI, from which simulations can
      be cancelled.

    * Improved spline fitting procedure and updated default fitting parameters.

2012-05-15  OSKAR 2.0.1-beta

    * Fixed polarisation simulation by changing element order of R and G Jones
      matrices. R is now a standard 2D rotation matrix, and G has elements
      ordered theta-phi, rather than phi-theta.

    * Fixed handling of settings parameters when using sky model flux filters.

    * Fixed logic checks on simulation output file settings.

    * Added binary utilities to modify and inspect settings files from
      command line or shell scripts.

    * Added message box in GUI to indicate when simulations are running.

2012-04-25  OSKAR 2.0.0-beta

    * First pre-release.
