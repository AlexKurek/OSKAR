2013-02-xx  OSKAR-2.2.0

    * Fixed incorrect 'power' filename suffix on voltage beam pattern images.

    * Changed sky model input file settings to make better use of settings
      groups.

    * Changed minimum CMake version requirement from 2.8 to 2.6.

    * Improved robustness of random-power-law source generators.

    * Improved reported error message if visibility file cannot be opened.

    * Improved reported error messages if telescope model cannot be loaded.

    * Improved chunking of data for complex-to-real DFT, so CUDA kernels
      should no longer time-out when imaging large visibility files.

    * Added the ability to load a telescope model containing only one station
      directory, which will be copied for all remaining stations.

    * Added support for hierarchical beamforming modes, using nested stations.

    * Added support for a pointing file, which can be used to override station
      beam directions.

    * Added options to override reference frequency and spectral index
      data for all sources in the sky model.

    * Added options to load HEALPix-format FITS files (with RING ordering)
      as a sky model component.

    * Added (sky model) option to remove sources for which Gaussian width
      solutions have failed.

    * Added the ability to filter sky model source fluxes after the scale by
      spectral index. This is done on a per-channel basis.

    * Added the ability to specify the amplitude of points when specifying
      generated HEALPix source grids.

    * Updated the mex function which reads OSKAR binary tag groups so that
      it is possible to specify a user index from which to load the group.

2012-11-20  OSKAR 2.1.1-beta

    * Fixed a bug in the MATLAB sky model load and save functions which
      caused the reference frequency and spectral index columns to be swapped.

    * Fixed a bug which set the minimum flux for the random power law generator
      filter to that used for the random broken power law generator filter.

    * Added option to use all CUDA devices found on the system, instead of
      specifying the list of device IDs. This is now the default behaviour.

2012-10-23  OSKAR 2.1.0-beta

    * Fixed a bug which caused visibility data from sky model chunks containing
      no sources to be accumulated incorrectly.

    * Fixed a bug which caused a list of CUDA device IDs to be ignored if
      specified inside quotes.

    * Fixed a bug in the OSKAR imager where selection of certain time and
      channel ranges incorrectly resulted in an error message, making it
      impossible to image a subset of the data cube.

    * Fixed simulation of bandwidth smearing for extended sources.

    * Added options to allow time-average smearing to be performed analytically.

    * Added options and updated the telescope model to allow uncorrelated
      noise to be added to the visibility data on a per-station basis.

    * Added options to allow an image to be made away from the observation
      phase centre.

    * Added options to allow an element pattern to have a cosine or Gaussian
      tapering function.

    * Added MATLAB function for plotting of visibility data.

    * Removed message printing when fitting ellipses to Gaussian sources, as
      this could result in an unhelpful number of warning messages.

    * Updated all telescope model settings for improved clarity.

    * Updated options for writing image files.

    * The settings GUI now allows for options to be disabled based on the
      value of another option. The display of various settings has been updated
      to make use of this facility.

2012-07-27  OSKAR 2.0.4-beta

    * Fixed a problem encountered when loading a Measurement Set in CASA
      containing only one frequency channel.

    * Fixed a problem encountered when attempting to load an invalid OSKAR
      binary file.

    * Fixed uncaught exceptions in simulation applications.

    * Added the ability to load FITS images directly as a sky model.

    * Added a binary utility to display CUDA system information.

    * Added a view filter in the GUI to show and highlight only settings of
      interest.

    * Removed dependency on main OSKAR library from widgets library and GUI.

2012-06-19  OSKAR 2.0.3-beta

    * Fixed a bug that could be encountered when evaluating a station beam
      using numerical element pattern data, with incorrect use of work
      buffers.

    * Fixed a build system bug related to finding CBLAS.

    * Added extra parameters to the build system that can be used to override
      the location of a number of library dependencies.

    * Added a binary utility to convert an OSKAR visibility file to a
      Measurement Set.

    * Added a binary utility to query the contents of an OSKAR binary file.

    * Added help dialog with link to documentation to the OSKAR GUI.

    * Updated visibility structure and OSKAR binary file to hold station
      coordinates, to be more self-contained.

2012-06-13  OSKAR 2.0.2-beta

    * Embedded simulation log in output files.

    * Added run progress dialog to show log in GUI, from which simulations can
      be cancelled.

    * Improved spline fitting procedure and updated default fitting parameters.

    * Updated simulation GUI close event behaviour to prompt if there are any
      unsaved changes.

    * Updated settings interface for the output of beam pattern images to
      allow the output of power (amplitude), phase and complex (voltage)
      patterns.

    * Updated the colour and formatting of options in the settings model used
      for the OSKAR GUI in order to highlight the various types of settings
      (required options, user specified values and defaults).

    * Improved the logic used in the display of the GUI (settings model)
      right-click menu.

    * Updated the CMake build system to improve compiler compatibility /
      portability when building in the default (release) mode.

2012-05-15  OSKAR 2.0.1-beta

    * Fixed polarisation simulation by changing element order of R and G Jones
      matrices. R is now a standard 2D rotation matrix, and G has elements
      ordered theta-phi, rather than phi-theta.

    * Fixed handling of settings parameters when using sky model flux filters.

    * Fixed logic checks on simulation output file settings.

    * Added binary utilities to modify and inspect settings files from
      command line or shell scripts.

    * Added message box in GUI to indicate when simulations are running.

2012-04-25  OSKAR 2.0.0-beta

    * First pre-release.
