2012-06-19  OSKAR 2.0.3-beta

    * Fixed a bug that could be encountered when evaluating a station beam
      using numerical element pattern data, with incorrect use of work
      buffers.

    * Fixed a build system bug related to finding CBLAS.

    * Added a binary utility to export a visibility file to a Measurement Set.

    * Added a binary utility to query the contents of an OSKAR binary file.

    * Added extra parameters to the build system that can be used to override
      the location of a number of library dependencies.

    * Added help dialog with link to documentation to the OSKAR GUI.

    * Updated visibility structure and OSKAR binary file to hold station
      coordinates, to be more self-contained.

2012-06-13  OSKAR 2.0.2-beta

    * Embedded simulation log in output files.

    * Added run progress dialog to show log in GUI, from which simulations can
      be cancelled.

    * Improved spline fitting procedure and updated default fitting parameters.

    * Updated simulation GUI close event behaviour to prompt if there are any
      unsaved changes.

    * Updated settings interface for the output of beam pattern images to
      allow the output of power (amplitude), phase and complex (voltage)
      patterns.

    * Updated the colour and formatting of options in the settings model used
      for the OSKAR GUI in order to highlight the various types of settings
      (required options, user specified values and defaults)

    * Improved the logic used in the display of the GUI (settings model)
      right-click menu.

    * Updated the CMake build system to improve compiler compatibility /
      portability when building in the default (release) mode.

2012-05-15  OSKAR 2.0.1-beta

    * Fixed polarisation simulation by changing element order of R and G Jones
      matrices. R is now a standard 2D rotation matrix, and G has elements
      ordered theta-phi, rather than phi-theta.

    * Fixed handling of settings parameters when using sky model flux filters.

    * Fixed logic checks on simulation output file settings.

    * Added binary utilities to modify and inspect settings files from
      command line or shell scripts.

    * Added message box in GUI to indicate when simulations are running.

2012-04-25  OSKAR 2.0.0-beta

    * First pre-release.
