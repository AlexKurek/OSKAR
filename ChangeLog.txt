2014-07-22  OSKAR-2.5.0

    * Changed settings to use a half-wavelength dipole by default,
      instead of a geometric dipole. 

    * Fixed a problem in the telescope model noise loader that caused it to
      incorrectly report an error in one situation.

    * Removed option to image interferometer output at end of simulation.
      (The OSKAR DFT imager is not recommended for general use.)

    * Removed element pattern fitting parameters from telescope model settings.

    * Created new application to fit element pattern data and write spline 
      coefficients to a telescope model in OSKAR binary format.
      Added new settings group for this.

    * Changed element pattern fitting procedure to use Ludwig-3 coordinate
      system internally. This generally produces better quality fits for a 
      given number of knots, and eliminates instability near the zenith.

    * Added the ability to specify element pattern data as a function of
      frequency. The element data closest to the current observing frequency
      is used.

    * Added the ability to specify element orientations when using
      numerical element pattern data.

    * Added the ability to specify multiple element types within a station.

    * Added option to use an analytic dipole with a definable length
      (in metres or wavelengths) as an element pattern.

    * Added option to completely normalise the centre of the station beam
      to 1.0 each time it is evaluated. This will effectively perform an
      amplitude calibration for a source at the phase centre.

    * Added option to turn off the station beam completely
      (use the "isotropic" station type for this).

    * Added scalar mode option (Stokes I only) to interferometer simulator.

    * Added UV range filter for visibility evaluation.

    * Added polarised sky model grid generator.

    * Added a reference frequency which is used to scale the FWHM of Gaussian
      beams for Gaussian beam station types.  

    * Added run log and settings file to Measurement Set HISTORY table.
      (Run log will now be propagated to images made with CASA.)

    * Improved efficiency of Measurement Set export.

2014-02-25  OSKAR-2.4.0

    * Added ability to specify a set of horizon-based permitted beam directions
      on a per-station basis.

    * Added ability to save spline data for fitted element patterns back out
      to the telescope model. Note, however, that the way numerical element
      pattern data is used will change considerably in future versions.

    * Fixed an issue building the Google unit test library.

    * Changed the behaviour of sky model filters to include the upper bound in
      flux, and the lower bound in radius. (Previously, both were excluded.)

2013-11-28  OSKAR-2.3.1

    * Fixed an issue building the OSKAR fits library.

    * Updated to Google test framework version 1.7.0

      correctly if using a single common station directory.

    * Fixed presence of multiple incorrect rows in DATA_DESCRIPTION and
      SPECTRAL_WINDOW tables for Measurement Set output.

    * Fixed visibility phase for sources greater than 90 degrees from the
      phase centre.

    * Removed redundant CORRECTED_DATA and MODEL_DATA columns from
      Measurement Set output.

    * Added per-source rotation measure to sky model.

    * Added additional meta-data to the OSKAR visibility structure to record
      telescope and station longitudes and latitudes, as well as nominal
      station receptor orientations. 

    * Added options to specify both image dimensions when making beam patterns.

    * Added a total intensity (Stokes I auto-correlation) beam pattern output
      mode.

    * Added check for updates when GUI starts.

    * Added warning message if settings file has been edited elsewhere
      while simultaneously open in the GUI.

    * Added telescope model name, channel bandwidth and time integration
      values to visibility files.

    * Added percentage time taken for various stages of the simulation to
      the message log.

    * Added a command line application (oskar_vis_add_noise) to
      add uncorrelated noise to visibilities.

    * Added application to display a summary of meta-data from an OSKAR
      visibility binary file (oskar_vis_summary).

    * Added the ability to use separate files to specify station element
      positions, gain and phase values, apodisation weights and orientations
      in the telescope model.

    * Added the ability to use station positions in Earth-centred coordinates.

    * Added station type for analytical scalar JVLA dishes, based on the AIPS
      task PBCOR. (http://www.aips.nrao.edu/cgi-bin/ZXHLP2.PL?PBCOR)

    * Updated options of oskar_image_summary to give the option to display the
      settings used to create the image.

    * Updated settings for beam pattern generation in order to support the 
      future addition of new beam pattern types.

2013-03-04  OSKAR-2.2.0

    * Fixed a subtle bug that could cause element pattern data to be loaded
      incorrectly in some telescope configurations, where element pattern data
      are present for one station but not for others.

    * Fixed incorrect 'power' filename suffix on voltage beam pattern images.

    * Changed sky model input file settings to make better use of settings
      groups.

      should no longer time-out when imaging large visibility files.

    * Added the ability to load a telescope model containing only one station
      directory, which will be copied for all remaining stations. This also
      applies recursively for sub-stations in sub-directories where relevant.

    * Added support for hierarchical beamforming modes, using nested stations.

    * Added support for a pointing file, which can be used to override station
      beam directions.

    * Added (sky model) option to remove sources for which Gaussian width
      solutions have failed.

    * Added the ability to filter sky model source fluxes after the scale by
      spectral index. This is done on a per-channel basis.

    * Added the ability to specify the amplitude of points when specifying
      generated HEALPix source grids.

    * Updated the mex function which reads OSKAR binary tag groups so that
      it is possible to specify a user index from which to load the group.

2012-11-20  OSKAR 2.1.1-beta

    * Fixed a bug in the MATLAB sky model load and save functions which
      caused the reference frequency and spectral index columns to be swapped.

    * Fixed a bug which set the minimum flux for the random power law generator
      filter to that used for the random broken power law generator filter.

    * Added option to use all CUDA devices found on the system, instead of
      specifying the list of device IDs. This is now the default behaviour.

    * Fixed a bug which caused visibility data from sky model chunks containing
      no sources to be accumulated incorrectly.

    * Fixed a bug which caused a list of CUDA device IDs to be ignored if
      specified inside quotes.

    * Fixed a bug in the OSKAR imager where selection of certain time and
      channel ranges incorrectly resulted in an error message, making it
      impossible to image a subset of the data cube.

    * Fixed simulation of bandwidth smearing for extended sources.

    * Added options to allow time-average smearing to be performed analytically.

    * Added options and updated the telescope model to allow uncorrelated
      noise to be added to the visibility data on a per-station basis.

    * Added options to allow an image to be made away from the observation
      phase centre.

    * Added options to allow an element pattern to have a cosine or Gaussian
      tapering function.

    * Added MATLAB function for plotting of visibility data.

    * Removed message printing when fitting ellipses to Gaussian sources, as
      this could result in an unhelpful number of warning messages.

    * Updated all telescope model settings for improved clarity.

    * Updated options for writing image files.

    * The settings GUI now allows for options to be disabled based on the
      value of another option. The display of various settings has been updated
      to make use of this facility.

    * Embedded simulation log in output files.

    * Added run progress dialog to show log in GUI, from which simulations can
      be cancelled.

    * Updated simulation GUI close event behaviour to prompt if there are any
      unsaved changes.

    * Updated settings interface for the output of beam pattern images to
      allow the output of power (amplitude), phase and complex (voltage)
      patterns.
