2012-06-12  OSKAR 2.0.2-beta

    * Embedded simulation log in output files.

    * Added run progress dialog to show log in GUI, from which simulations can
      be cancelled.

    * Improved spline fitting procedure and updated default fitting parameters.

    * Updated simulation GUI close event behaviour to prompt if there are any
      unsaved changes.

    * Updated settings interface for the output of beam pattern images to
      allow the output of power (amplitude), phase and complex (voltage)
      patterns.

2012-05-15  OSKAR 2.0.1-beta

    * Fixed polarisation simulation by changing element order of R and G Jones
      matrices. R is now a standard 2D rotation matrix, and G has elements
      ordered theta-phi, rather than phi-theta.

    * Fixed handling of settings parameters when using sky model flux filters.

    * Fixed logic checks on simulation output file settings.

    * Added binary utilities to modify and inspect settings files from
      command line or shell scripts.

    * Added message box in GUI to indicate when simulations are running.

2012-04-25  OSKAR 2.0.0-beta

    * First pre-release.
