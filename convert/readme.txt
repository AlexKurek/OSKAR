Coordianate system specifiers
===============================================================================
* tangent_plane_direction
  - direction cosines relative to a tangent point (or phase centre).
  
* apparent_ha_dec
  - Equatorial coordinate system used to specify positions of celestial 
    objects. Hour Angle, Declination.
    
* apparent_ra_dec
  - Equatorial coordinate system used to specify positions of celestial 
    objects. Right Ascension, Declination.
    
* az_el
  - Spherical coordinates in the horizontal frame. Azimuth is measured from
    North to East. Elevation is measured from the horizon.
     
* horizon_direction
  - Direction cosines defined in the local horizontal system (East-North-Up).
  
* ecef
  - Geocentric cartesian coordiantes, Earth-Centred-Earth-Fixed coordinates.
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECEF)
    
* geodetic_spherical
  - A Standard coordinate frame for the Earth based on a standard spheroidal 
    reference surface.
    
* galactic
  - A Celestial coordinate system in spherical coordinates with the Sun at its
    centre.

* fk5
  - Equatorial system as measured on the 1st January 2000. Also known as J2000.
  
* horizon
  - Cartesian positions in the local horizon frame (East-North-Up). 


Modifiers
===============================================================================
* cuda
  - Function implemented on the GPU using NVIDIA CUDA. Either device Kernels
    and/or Kernel wrappers.
